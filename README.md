## Cloning Repository
* Open Git Bash in your system and navigate to a folder of your choice to clone the repository.
* Use the following commands to clone repository into your local system.
```
git clone https://github.com/VinuthnaGangula/product-page.git
cd product-page
```

### In case of Aunthentication failure
* In case the clone fails because of the repository being private, please create Personal Access Token from 'Developer Settings' in the Settings tab, and use the following clone URL instead.
Clone URL: git clone https://<PAT>@github.com/VinuthnaGangula/product-page.git

* You can refer to [this](https://kettan007.medium.com/how-to-clone-a-git-repository-using-personal-access-token-a-step-by-step-guide-ab7b54d4ef83#:~:text=Step%201%3A%20Generate%20a%20Personal%20Access%20Token%20(PAT)&text=For%20cloning%20repositories%2C%20the%20%E2%80%9Crepo,should%20be%20treated%20like%20passwords.) article for more clarity.

**Note**: Please let me know if you want to avoid cloning the repository using the steps listed above, in case of aunthentication failure. I can make the repository public anytime, if required.
